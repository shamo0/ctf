# CTF Writeups

I like to participate in Capture The Flag competitions. CTF competitions generally consist of participants breaking, investigating, reverse engineering and doing anything they can think of to reach the end goal and find the flag! 

As much as I do not enjoy doing the writeups I'm trying to get better at doing them.
